## Title : Swachh Bot :recycle:
## Overview: :file_folder:
- The world now is facing a huge problem in waste management. The first and foremost step of waste management is waste collection; we often find that the management is not quite effective in its collection. Unattended waste is found lying on the road days after days, which eventually becomes the breeding ground of disease causing pests. To prevent such things we have come up with an idea to create a bot that will collect trash around it.

## Working and Future Prospects: :memo:

- The bot is made to work with computer vision and machine learning techniques. It is trained to distinguish wastes and whether it is biodegradable or non-biodegradable(in future). It can be used by hospitals, airports, malls, offices, and any area that requires frequent cleaning. We have also planned to make it work on roads, then we will keep in mind about the road structure in India, its chances of being stolen or destroyed and likewise a modified version will be created in future.
- We have trained our dataset using the HAAR Cascade GUI, at present it can recognise plastics, it recognizes the plastic, picks it up and moves forward to pick more, when its tray is complete, it comes back to the owner.

## Uniqueness, strategy, affordability: :pushpin:
- The main technologies used are computer vision, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Through proper training and testing an algorithm will be created that will make the bot pick trash around it.The idea is new, and no such product already exists. It will be very helpful as it will reduce the huge man-power which is otherwise required for frequent cleaning. It will also ensure that biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes are not mixed, which is a huge problem, because clearly the ‘green and black dustbin’ strategy used by our municipality wasn’t effective. This bot would act as a solution to this problem, as it can easily distinguish, with very less chances of error. A small bot that can work wonders, won’t come with a huge price tag. It will be affordable, and we shall try to make the bot using discarded metal, which will further cut down the cost.
